Impact of Cell Architecture and Sensing Methodology on Read Performance in SRAM and FeFET Memories

Modern computing systems increasingly demand higher speed, lower power, and greater robustness from memory subsystems. While SRAM remains the primary choice for on-chip storage due to its reliability and fast access times, conventional 6T SRAM cells face challenges in variability, scaling, and read stability. Emerging alternatives—including 8T/10T SRAM variants and FeFET-based non-volatile memory cells—offer promising improvements but require careful evaluation of their read behavior.

This project systematically compares read latency and read static noise margin (RSNM) across a wide range of memory cell architectures and sensing schemes. The goal is to identify which combinations of bit-cell topology and sense-amplifier design provide the best trade-offs for high-performance, low-power memory systems.
